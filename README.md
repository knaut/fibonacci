# Fibonacci (WIP)

A practice project for React Hooks and more on the subject of the Fibonacci sequence.

## About Fibonacci Sequence

What is the Fibonacci sequence? It's a mathematical pattern found in natural and human creations. It's found in Romanesque broccoli, the Parthenon, and Nautilus shells. Aside from having unique structural implications for organisms, it is often used by people for its relationship to the "Golden Ratio".

## Storybook

`npm run storybook`

Run this command to start Storybook. So far there is only one component, which is a range selector that lets you see the Fibonacci numbers up to the 25th iteration.
